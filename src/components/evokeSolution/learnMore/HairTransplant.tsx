            <h1>Hair Transplant</h1>

            <p>
            A hair transplant is a surgical procedure that involves transferring permanent hair from areas of the scalp that typically do not experience hair loss (such as the sides and back of the head) to areas affected by permanent hair loss. This advanced procedure can also be used to restore eyebrows and beards, offering a complete solution for those seeking to regain their natural hair. Hair transplants are minor day surgeries lasting between 3-8 hours and are performed under local anesthesia, eliminating the need for hospitalization afterward.

                    Hair transplants are recommended for individuals experiencing significant hair loss that cannot be effectively treated with non-surgical options or medications. This includes:

                                <span>Procedure:</span>Individual hair follicles are extracted without leaving a linear scar on the back of the scalp. It is the most common cosmetic procedure globally and is performed under local anesthesia, allowing the patient to remain awake and aware throughout the process.

  <ul>
    <li>the advice/information/opinion on diagnosis you may receive could be limited and provisional;</li>

    <li>there are inherent differences between a physical consultation and tele-consultation and thus there is a dependency/reliability on the information provided by you to the third party registered medical practitioner and hence any such information that is false, misleading, inaccurate, outdated or incomplete will immediately render the opinion, consultation, test results, and all details therein null and void;</li>
    <li>in some events, the third party registered medical practitioners may determine that the transmitted information is of inadequate quality and may ask for more information, without which he/she may refuse to answer the query;</li>
    <li>in rare cases, the third party registered medical practitioners may feel that the query may not be answerable without physically examining the patient/ Users and the consultation may be refused forthwith;</li>
    <li>in very rare instances, security protocols could fail, causing a breach of privacy of personal medical information; and</li>
    <li>delays in medical evaluation and answers could occur due to deficiencies or failures of the service as per those mentioned in these Terms.</li>
